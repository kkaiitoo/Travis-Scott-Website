<h3>About Travis</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Scott is currently playing off the 2024 Europe/UK leg of his wildly successful, and record breaking<br>
CIRCUS MAXIMUS TOUR which included 44 sold out stops across North America in 2023 and early 2024, and was the<br>
highest grossing rap tour. The tour has since gone on to gross nearly $27 million with more than 270,000 attendees<br>
across the first 11 dates of the Europe/UK leg. Travis is also the first American Hip Hop artist to sell 200,000<br>
tickets in a year across 3 shows in Italy.<br></p>

    <p>Internationally acclaimed global superstar and Houston native Travis Scott is not only a leader in music, but in<br>
fashion, film, culture, and beyond. The diamond-certified eight-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated artist, designer,<br>
style icon, actor, producer, entrepreneur, and Cactus Jack CEO/founder has changed the course of hip-hop with<br>
a procession of groundbreaking albums and conversation-starting moves.<br></p>

    <p>Heralded as the ‘‘album of the decade,’ the critically acclaimed UTOPIA continues to enshrine him as the<br>
culture’s foremost sonic innovator and was the biggest-selling hip-hop release of 2023, holding strong at No.1 on the<br>
Billboard Top 200 for four weeks running, and garnering over 50 billion streams globally. Additionally, Spotify named<br>
UTOPIA the most streamed album in its first week in 2023, and Apple Music confirmed the biggest first-day<br>
streams of an album in 2023. UTOPIA finds GRAMMY® nominated Travis Scott at the height of his powers as a performer,<br>
songwriter, producer, and collaborator proving once again that nobody sounds quite like him.</p>
